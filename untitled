Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind.

Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications.

We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.



We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.



Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us.

Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion.

We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge.

In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis.

In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits.

In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace.
