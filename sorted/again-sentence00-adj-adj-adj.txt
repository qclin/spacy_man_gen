repudiates to
create a world
for new or global time
in particular context

fair, same, enlightened
our real right
is to
be the whole

from singular home
----------------------------------------------

your parental governance
requires to
invade the claim
to enlightened But global conversation
of only world
----------------------------------------------
own, military, own
our only future
grows to
be the air
of particular and virtual humanity
of seamless government
----------------------------------------------
terrified, own, humane
our immune product
is to
arrest the construction
by global or only determination
at uninformed world
----------------------------------------------

your moral liberty
is to
work the birth
of obsolete nor global today
